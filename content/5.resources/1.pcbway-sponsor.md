## How to Order

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Step 1: Visit Project Page

:prose-ol
1. Go to the [Moto32 PCBWay Project](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/Motogadget_Clone_0a54cb40.html)
2. Review the PCB images and specifications
3. Click **"Add to Cart"**

#### Step 2: Configure Your Order

**PCB Specifications** (pre-filled, but verify):

| Parameter | Recommended Value |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **PCB Qty** | 5 (minimum) or 10 (better value) |
