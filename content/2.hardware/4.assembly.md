### Workspace Setup

Create a proper electronics workbench:

:prose-ul{icon="i-lucide-check"}
- Well-lit area (LED task light recommended)
- Static-free surface (ESD mat)
- Organized component storage
- Good ventilation (solder fumes)
- Clean, dust-free environment
- Comfortable seating for precision work

## Assembly Methods

### Method 1: Solder Paste & Hot Air (Recommended)

**Best for**: Multiple boards, professional results

**Process:**
:prose-ol
1. Apply solder paste with stencil
2. Place all components with tweezers
3. Reflow with hot air station or oven
4. Inspect and touch up any issues

**Advantages:**
- Faster for multiple boards
- Professional results
- Easier alignment of small parts
- Less chance of cold joints

### Method 2: Hand Soldering with Iron

**Best for**: Single boards, learning

**Process:**
:prose-ol
1. Apply flux to pads
2. Place component
3. Solder one pin to tack it down
4. Solder remaining pins
5. Inspect and clean

**Advantages:**
- No special equipment needed
- Full control over each joint
- Easy to rework mistakes
- Good learning experience

### Method 3: PCBWay Assembly Service

**Best for**: First units, no soldering experience

**Process:**
:prose-ol
1. Order PCBs with assembly service
2. Upload BOM and Pick & Place files
3. Wait for assembled boards to arrive
4. Skip directly to testing phase

**Advantages:**
- No soldering required
- Professionally assembled
- Quality guaranteed
- More expensive but saves time

## Assembly Order

Work from smallest to largest components:

:prose-ol
1. **Small passives (0402)**: Resistors and capacitors
2. **Larger passives (0603)**: Capacitors
3. **Small ICs (SOT-23)**: Buck converter
4. **Medium ICs (SOP-16)**: CH340C USB-UART
5. **MOSFETs (TO-252)**: Output switches
6. **Large modules**: ESP32-S3
7. **Connectors**: USB-C, headers
8. **Through-hole**: Crystal oscillator (if present)

::callout{icon="i-lucide-info" color="blue"}
**Why This Order?** Small components are easier to place before larger ones block access. Heat-sensitive components (ESP32) should be last.
::

## Step-by-Step Assembly

### Step 1: Prepare the PCB

:prose-ol
1. **Inspect PCB** for damage
   - Check for scratches, contamination
   - Verify all pads are intact
   - Confirm no broken traces
2. **Clean surface** with IPA if needed
3. **Secure in PCB holder** or vise
4. **Verify orientation** (check silkscreen markings)

### Step 2: 0402 Resistors

**Components:** R1-R22 (22 resistors total)

**Important**: 0402 parts are TINY (1mm × 0.5mm). Organization is critical!

:prose-ol
1. **Organize resistors** by value in labeled containers
2. Apply small amount of **flux** to pads
3. **Pre-tin one pad** with small solder amount
4. **Place resistor** with tweezers while re-heating pre-tinned pad
5. **Solder other end**
6. **Inspect** with magnification

**Common Values:**
- 10kΩ: 10 pieces (R1, R6-R8, R10, R13-R17)
- 1kΩ: 4 pieces (R3-R5, R9)
- Others: Various (see BOM)

**Tips:**
- Work in good lighting
- Use flux generously
- Don't apply too much heat (<3 seconds per joint)
- Check orientation (doesn't matter for resistors)

### Step 3: 0402 Capacitors

**Components:** C1, C3, C5-C9, C13 (8 capacitors)

**Same process as resistors:**

:prose-ol
1. Organize by value (1µF, 100nF)
2. Apply flux to pads
3. Pre-tin one pad
4. Place and solder first side
5. Solder second side
6. Inspect for shorts

**Polarity**: Ceramic capacitors have no polarity (can go either way)

### Step 4: 0603 Capacitors

**Components:** C2, C4, C10-C12 (5 capacitors)

Larger than 0402, easier to handle:

- Same technique as smaller caps
- 0603 size: 1.6mm × 0.8mm
- Values: 22µF and 10µF
- More forgiving alignment

### Step 5: Diodes

**Components:** D1 (SMA), D2-D3 (SOD-123FL), D4-D5 (SMC)

::callout{icon="i-lucide-alert-triangle" color="red"}
**POLARITY CRITICAL**: Diodes must be oriented correctly or circuit will not work (may be damaged)!
::

**Identifying Polarity:**
- **Cathode marking**: Line on component body
- **PCB marking**: Line on silkscreen shows cathode
- **Match markings**: Component line to PCB line

**Soldering:**
:prose-ol
1. Check datasheet for orientation
2. Apply flux to pads
3. Pre-tin one pad
4. Place diode (verify orientation!)
5. Solder both ends
6. Double-check polarity before proceeding

### Step 6: Buck Converter (U3)

**Component:** AP63203WU-7 (SOT-23-6)

**Package:** 6-pin SOT-23 (small IC)

:prose-ol
1. Apply flux to all 6 pads
2. **Check pin 1 marking** (dot or line on IC)
3. Align IC carefully (pin 1 to marked pad)
4. Tack down one corner pin
5. Check alignment, adjust if needed
6. Solder remaining 5 pins
7. Inspect for bridges between pins

**Pin 1 Identification:**
- IC: Dot, dimple, or line near pin 1
- PCB: Dot or different pad shape

**Troubleshooting:**
- **Solder bridges**: Use solder wick or flux and drag technique
- **Tombstoning**: Reduce heat, ensure even pad temperature

### Step 7: USB-UART Bridge (U2)

**Component:** CH340C (SOP-16, 150mil pitch)

**Package:** 16-pin SOIC, easier than SOT-23

**Method 1 - Drag Soldering:**
:prose-ol
1. Apply flux generously to all pads
2. Align IC carefully (pin 1 to marked pad)
3. Tack opposite corner pins
4. Verify alignment
5. Apply solder to tip and **drag across pins**
6. Flux prevents bridges from forming
7. Clean with IPA and inspect

**Method 2 - Individual Pins:**
:prose-ol
1. Place and tack IC as above
2. Solder each pin individually
3. Use minimal solder
4. Keep iron time <2 seconds per pin

### Step 8: MOSFETs (Q5-Q12)

**Components:** 8x DMP4015SK3Q-13 (TO-252-2 / DPAK)

**Larger components with thermal pad**

::callout{icon="i-lucide-alert-circle" color="amber"}
**Orientation Critical**: Tab (drain) must align with PCB thermal pad. Check datasheet and PCB silkscreen.
::

**Soldering:**
:prose-ol
1. Apply flux to pads
2. Place MOSFET (check orientation!)
3. **Tack down tab first** (this is the thermal/electrical connection)
4. Solder gate and source pins
5. Add more solder to tab for good thermal contact
6. Inspect alignment and solder joints

**Tips:**
- Tab needs good solder joint (electrical connection)
- Use higher temperature for thermal pad (large copper area)
- Hold iron longer (5-7 seconds) for tab
- Check for gaps under component

### Step 9: ESP32-S3 Module (U1)

**Component:** ESP32-S3-WROOM-1-N8R2

**Large module with many pins**

::callout{icon="i-lucide-zap" color="blue"}
**Most Expensive Component**: Take your time and be careful!
::

**Method 1 - Hot Air (Recommended):**
:prose-ol
1. Apply solder paste to all pads (use stencil if available)
2. Place module carefully (align castellated edges)
3. Heat from bottom with hot air (320-350°C, medium airflow)
4. Watch solder paste reflow (shiny appearance)
5. Remove heat and let cool naturally

**Method 2 - Soldering Iron:**
:prose-ol
1. Apply flux to ALL pads
2. Place module (verify alignment)
3. Tack down opposite corner pads
4. Solder around perimeter systematically
5. Use drag soldering for pin rows
6. Check each pad with magnification

**Verification:**
- All pads should have visible solder fillets
- No cold solder joints (grainy appearance)
- No bridges between pads
- Module sits flat on PCB

### Step 10: USB-C Connector

**Component:** TYPE-C-31-M-12

**Mixed through-hole and SMD pads**

:prose-ol
1. Insert connector (pins through holes)
2. Ensure connector sits flush against PCB
3. Solder through-hole pins first (mechanical strength)
4. Solder SMD pads for USB signals
5. Add extra solder to mounting pins for durability

**Tips:**
- Use more heat for through-hole pins
- Check connector is straight before soldering all pins
- Test USB insertion/removal after assembly

### Step 11: Crystal Oscillator (X1)

**Component:** HC-49S 12MHz

**Through-hole component**

:prose-ol
1. Insert crystal into PCB holes
2. Bend leads slightly to hold in place
3. Solder from bottom side
4. Trim excess leads with flush cutters

### Step 12: Optional Components

**Headers / Expansion Connectors:**

If adding GPIO headers:
:prose-ol
1. Insert header pins
2. Use tape to hold straight
3. Solder one pin
4. Check alignment
5. Solder remaining pins

## Post-Assembly

### Visual Inspection

**Check every joint with magnification:**

:prose-ul{icon="i-lucide-search"}
- **Good joints**: Shiny, smooth fillet, wets both pad and component
- **Cold joints**: Grainy, dull appearance - reheat!
- **Insufficient solder**: No fillet visible - add more
- **Bridges**: Solder connects adjacent pins - remove with wick
- **Tombstoning**: Component standing on end - desolder and replace

### Cleaning

:prose-ol
1. Brush IPA over entire PCB with cotton swab
2. Scrub gently to remove flux residue
3. Inspect under magnification again
4. Let dry completely (5-10 minutes)
5. Repeat if needed for stubborn flux

::callout{icon="i-lucide-droplets" color="blue"}
**Flux Removal**: No-clean flux doesn't require removal but looks better cleaned. Rosin flux should be removed.
::

### Electrical Testing

**Before applying power:**

:prose-ol
1. **Visual check for shorts**
   - Use multimeter in continuity mode
   - Check 12V to GND: Should be open circuit (>1MΩ)
   - Check 3.3V rail to GND: Should be open circuit
2. **Component orientation**
   - All diodes correct polarity
   - All ICs pin 1 in correct position
   - MOSFETs oriented properly

### First Power-Up

**Using USB-C only (safest):**

:prose-ol
1. Connect USB-C cable to computer
2. **Watch for smoke or unusual smells** (if any, disconnect immediately!)
3. Measure voltages:
   - 3.3V rail should be present and stable
   - Check with multimeter at test points
4. Computer should detect CH340 USB device
5. LED indicators should illuminate (if populated)

**If 3.3V is present and stable:**
:prose-ol
1. Disconnect USB
2. Connect 12V supply (use current-limited bench supply if available)
3. Set current limit to 500mA initially
4. Power up and verify:
   - 12V input present
   - 3.3V rail still stable
   - No excessive current draw (<200mA idle)
5. Gradually increase current limit to 2A

::callout{icon="i-lucide-alert-circle" color="red"}
**STOP if**: Smoke, burning smell, excessive heat, or current limit triggers immediately. Disconnect and troubleshoot before continuing.
::

## Troubleshooting Assembly

### Common Issues

**No 3.3V output:**
- Check buck converter (U3) orientation
- Verify input caps C10, C11 are installed
- Check for shorts on 3.3V rail
- Measure 12V input to U3

**ESP32 not detected on USB:**
- Check CH340C (U2) orientation
- Verify USB-C connector soldering (all pins)
- Check 12MHz crystal (X1) installation
- Verify 3.3V present on U2 VCC pin

**Outputs don't work:**
- Check MOSFET orientation (each one!)
- Verify gate resistors are installed
- Test with multimeter: Gate to source voltage when activated
- Check ESP32 GPIO connections

**USB connection unstable:**
- Reflow USB-C connector solder joints
- Check USB data line resistors (R18-R21)
- Verify TVS diodes (D4, D5) not shorted

### Repair Techniques

**Removing components:**
:prose-ol
1. Apply flux liberally
2. Heat all pins simultaneously with hot air
3. Gently lift component with tweezers
4. Clean pads with solder wick
5. Apply fresh solder and place new component

**Fixing solder bridges:**
:prose-ol
1. Add more flux (counterintuitive but works!)
2. Drag soldering iron tip across pins
3. If persistent, use solder wick to remove excess
4. Re-solder with minimal solder amount

**Lifted pads:**
- If pad lifts from PCB, carefully scrape soldermask to expose trace
- Solder component directly to exposed trace
- Use wire jumper if necessary
