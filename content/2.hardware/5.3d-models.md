### Importing the Model

**General Steps:**

:prose-ol
1. Download `3D_File.step` from repository
2. Open your CAD software
3. Import/Open STEP file
4. Model appears as assembly with all components
5. Use as reference for your enclosure design

**Tips:**
- Model is to scale (1:1)
- Component bodies are simplified for performance
- All critical dimensions are accurate
- Use for fitment checks and clearance verification

## Enclosure Design

### Design Considerations

When designing an enclosure for Moto32:

**Protection Requirements:**
:prose-ul{icon="i-lucide-shield"}
- **Water resistance**: IP65 or better recommended
- **Dust protection**: Sealed against road dust and debris
- **Impact resistance**: Protect from vibration and minor impacts
- **Heat dissipation**: Ventilation or thermal conduction for MOSFETs

**Access Requirements:**
:prose-ul{icon="i-lucide-door-open"}
- USB-C port accessible for programming
- Wire entry/exit points for power and outputs
- Optional: Status LED light pipes
- Optional: Button access for reset/boot

**Mounting:**
:prose-ul{icon="i-lucide-hammer"}
- Standoffs to isolate PCB from enclosure bottom
- Rubber vibration dampeners
- Secure mounting to motorcycle frame
- Cable strain relief

### Enclosure Materials

| Material | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| **3D Printed ABS** | Custom fit, easy prototyping | Lower strength, poor heat resistance | Testing, one-offs |
| **3D Printed Nylon** | Strong, flexible, good heat resistance | More expensive, harder to print | Final personal builds |
| **Aluminum Box** | Excellent heat dissipation, EMI shielding | Requires machining for openings | High-performance setups |
| **Plastic Project Box** | Cheap, readily available | Generic sizing, limited protection | Quick testing |
| **Potted/Conformal Coated** | Maximum protection | Difficult to repair or modify | Permanent installations |

### Example Enclosure Design

**Simple 3D Printed Enclosure:**

**Features:**
- 5mm clearance above tallest component
- M3 mounting holes align with PCB
- USB-C cutout in side wall
- Cable gland for wire entry (waterproof)
- Snap-fit or screw-on lid
- Optional gasket groove for sealing

### 3D Printing Settings

For printing your enclosure:

**Recommended Settings:**
- **Material**: PETG or Nylon (heat resistant)
- **Layer height**: 0.2mm
- **Infill**: 20-30%
- **Walls**: 3-4 perimeters
- **Top/Bottom**: 5 layers minimum
- **Supports**: Only where necessary

**Post-Processing:**
- Clean up support material
- Drill mounting holes to exact size
- Smooth internal surfaces
- Test fit before final assembly

## Mounting Solutions

### Option 1: Under-Seat Mounting

**Most common location for motorcycles**

:prose-ul{icon="i-lucide-check"}
- Protected from weather
- Easy wire routing to battery
- Accessible for maintenance
- Good heat dissipation

**Mounting:**
- Use existing frame mounting points
- Or add custom bracket
- Vibration-isolating mounts essential
- Secure all connectors with zip ties

### Option 2: Behind Headlight

**For cafe racer or minimal builds**

:prose-ul{icon="i-lucide-check"}
- Keeps electronics forward
- Shorter wire runs to front lights
- Hidden from view
- May need waterproof enclosure

### Option 3: Side Panel Integration

**Integrated into custom bodywork**

:prose-ul{icon="i-lucide-check"}
- Clean aesthetic
- Custom fabrication required
- Good for show bikes
- Ensure adequate ventilation

### Vibration Isolation

Motorcycles create significant vibration. Protect your electronics:

**Methods:**
:prose-ul{icon="i-lucide-wifi"}
- **Rubber grommets** in mounting holes
- **Foam padding** in enclosure
- **Silicone dampeners** under standoffs
- **Wire strain relief** prevent fatigue

## Thermal Management

### Heat Sources

Components that generate heat:
- **Buck converter (U3)**: ~1W dissipation
- **MOSFETs (Q5-Q12)**: 0.5-1W each under load
- **ESP32 module**: 0.5W typical

**Total heat**: 5-10W depending on load

### Cooling Solutions

**Passive Cooling (Recommended):**
:prose-ul{icon="i-lucide-wind"}
- PCB copper acts as heatsink
- Enclosure conducts heat away
- Ventilation holes (with mesh to keep water out)
- Thermal pads from MOSFETs to enclosure

**Active Cooling (Rarely Needed):**
- Small 12V fan for extreme conditions
- Liquid cooling not necessary

## Wiring Harness Integration

### Connector Strategy

**Internal PCB Side:**
- Solder wires directly to PCB pads, OR
- Add screw terminals, OR
- Use board-to-wire connectors

**External (Motorcycle Side):**
- Deutsch automotive connectors (waterproof)
- Weatherpack connectors
- Spade terminals with heat shrink
- Avoid exposed terminals

### Cable Management

:prose-ul{icon="i-lucide-cable"}
- Use appropriately sized wire (14-16 AWG for power)
- Color code wires (standard motorcycle colors)
- Label both ends of every wire
- Use split loom or heat shrink for protection
- Strain relief at enclosure entry
- Keep high current and signal wires separated
