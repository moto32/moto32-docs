## Sourcing Components

### Primary Supplier: LCSC Electronics

**Why LCSC?**
:prose-ul{icon="i-lucide-check"}
- All LCSC part numbers provided in BOM
- Competitive pricing
- Ships worldwide
- Good stock availability
- Easy integration with PCBWay assembly service

**Ordering from LCSC:**

:prose-ol
1. Go to [LCSC.com](https://www.lcsc.com)
2. Upload the BOM CSV file (if supported)
3. Or search each LCSC part number manually
4. Add to cart and checkout
5. Select shipping method

::callout{icon="i-lucide-truck" color="blue"}
**Shipping**: Economy shipping is cheap but slow (2-4 weeks). Express options available for faster delivery.
::

### Alternative Suppliers

If LCSC is not available or convenient:

#### Mouser Electronics

Global supplier with extensive inventory:
- Search by manufacturer part number
- May need to find equivalents
- Higher prices but faster shipping to US/Europe
- Excellent technical support

**Example Equivalents:**
- Capacitors: Any Samsung/Murata X7R with same value/voltage
- Resistors: Any 1% thick film with same value
- ESP32 module: Must be exact (ESP32-S3-WROOM-1)

#### DigiKey

Similar to Mouser:
- Large selection
- Premium pricing
- Fast delivery
- Good for prototypes

#### AliExpress / eBay

Budget options:
- Much cheaper for hobbyists
- Longer shipping times (4-8 weeks)
- Quality can vary
- Good for non-critical components
- **Verify specifications carefully**

::callout{icon="i-lucide-alert-triangle" color="amber"}
**Counterfeit Warning**: Be cautious with ESP32 modules and ICs from unknown sellers. Counterfeits exist and may not work properly.
::

### Minimum Order Quantities (MOQ)

Most distributors have MOQs:

| Supplier | Typical MOQ | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| LCSC | 1-10 pieces | Very low MOQs |
| Mouser | 1 piece | No MOQ issues |
| DigiKey | 1 piece | No MOQ issues |
| Manufacturers | 1000+ pieces | Only for production |

**For Building Multiple Units:**
- Order 10-20x quantity for safety margin
- Keep extras for repairs and future builds
- Split orders with friends to reduce cost

## Component Substitutions

### Acceptable Substitutes

Some components can be substituted with equivalents:

#### Capacitors
- **Any Samsung/Murata/TDK**: Same value, voltage, X7R/X5R dielectric
- **Package size**: Can use 0603 instead of 0402 (easier to solder)
- **Voltage rating**: Must meet or exceed requirement (16V+ for 12V rail, 10V+ for 3.3V rail)

#### Resistors
- **Any brand**: 1% tolerance, same package and value
- **Package size**: 0603 can replace 0402
- **Power rating**: 1/16W (0402) or 1/10W (0603) is adequate

#### MOSFETs
**Use exact part or verified equivalents only:**
- Must be P-channel
- VDS ≥ 40V
- ID ≥ 10A
- RDS(on) ≤ 100mΩ
- Logic-level gate (VGS(th) < 2V)
- TO-252 or similar package

**Possible alternatives:**
- IRF7404TRPBF
- DMP3098L
- Si4425DDY

::callout{icon="i-lucide-alert-circle" color="red"}
**Critical Components**: ESP32 module (U1), CH340C (U2), and buck converter (U3) should NOT be substituted unless you are experienced. Wrong parts will not work.
::

### Not Recommended for Substitution

These must be exact or carefully verified equivalents:

- **ESP32-S3-WROOM-1**: Specific pinout, firmware compatibility
- **CH340C**: Other CH340 variants may work but different pinouts
- **AP63203WU-7**: Other buck converters need circuit redesign
- **TVS diodes**: Voltage rating critical for protection

## Purchasing Strategy

### For One Unit (Prototype)

**Total cost estimate: $30-50**

- Order PCB from PCBWay: ~$20-30 for 5 pieces
- Order components from LCSC: ~$15-20 including shipping
- Shipping and taxes may apply

::callout{icon="i-lucide-lightbulb" color="yellow"}
**Tip**: Build 2-3 units since you'll get 5 PCBs and component costs are similar in bulk.
::

### For Multiple Units (Small Batch)

**Cost per unit: $15-25 (for 10 units)**

- PCBs: Order more for volume discount
- Components: Buy 20x quantity (10% extra for mistakes)
- Consider PCBWay assembly service for consistent quality

### PCBWay Assembly Service

**Fully assembled unit: $50-100 per piece**

PCBWay offers complete assembly:

:prose-ol
1. Order PCBs with assembly service
2. Upload BOM and Pick & Place files
3. PCBWay sources all components
4. Automated assembly and inspection
5. Receive fully assembled, tested units

**Benefits:**
:prose-ul{icon="i-lucide-check"}
- No soldering required
- Professional quality
- Consistent results
- Saves time
- Good for first unit (reference for hand assembly)

**Upload these files:**
- `Gerber_Canarin_MUX_PCB.zip`
- `BOM_Canarin_MUX.csv`
- `PickAndPlace_PCB_Canarin_MUX.csv`

## Quality Checks

### Receiving Components

When components arrive:

:prose-ul{icon="i-lucide-package-check"}
- **Verify quantities** match order
- **Check package integrity** (no damaged bags)
- **Inspect visually** for obvious defects
- **Organize by type** in labeled containers
- **Keep anti-static bags** for storage

### Component Identification

**Reading Resistor/Capacitor Codes:**

0402/0603 packages are too small for markings. Rely on:
- Original packaging with labels
- LCSC order list
- Organize carefully during assembly

**IC Verification:**
- Check marking on IC matches part number
- Look for date codes and manufacturer logo
- Beware blank/remarked ICs (counterfeits)

### Storage

Proper storage extends component life:

- **ESD protection**: Keep ICs in anti-static bags
- **Moisture control**: Store in dry environment (use desiccant)
- **Organization**: Label everything clearly
- **Temperature**: Room temperature, avoid extremes
