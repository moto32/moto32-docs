## Step 3: PCB Assembly

### Tools Required

:prose-ul{icon="i-lucide-wrench"}
- Soldering iron with fine tip (or hot air rework station)
- Solder paste (for SMD components)
- Tweezers (fine point, ESD-safe)
- Magnifying glass or microscope
- Flux (no-clean recommended)
- Isopropyl alcohol (IPA) for cleaning
- Multimeter
- ESD mat and wrist strap

### Assembly Process

::callout{icon="i-lucide-lightbulb" color="yellow"}
**First Time?** Consider ordering PCBWay's assembly service for your first unit. Then you can use it as a reference for hand-assembling additional units.
::

**Assembly Order:**

:prose-ol
1. **Small passives first** (0402 resistors and capacitors)
   - Apply solder paste with stencil or syringe
   - Place components with tweezers
   - Reflow with hot air or hot plate
2. **Larger passives** (0603 capacitors)
3. **ICs and active components**
   - ESP32 module (careful with alignment)
   - MOSFETs (watch orientation)
   - Buck converter IC
   - USB-UART chip
4. **Connectors and mechanical parts**
   - USB-C connector
   - Pin headers
5. **Inspection and cleaning**
   - Check for solder bridges under microscope
   - Clean with IPA
6. **Initial testing** (see Step 4)

### Assembly Tips

::prose-ul{icon="i-lucide-check"}
- Work in a well-lit, static-free environment
- Apply flux generously for better solder flow
- Use hot air at 350°C for reflow (adjust based on solder paste)
- Double-check ESP32 module orientation before soldering
- Verify polarity of diodes and MOSFETs
- Take breaks to avoid fatigue-induced mistakes

For detailed assembly instructions with photos, see the [Hardware Assembly Guide](/hardware/assembly).

## Step 4: Initial Testing

Before installing on your motorcycle, thoroughly test the unit:

### Visual Inspection

:prose-ul{icon="i-lucide-eye"}
- No solder bridges between pins
- All components properly oriented
- USB-C connector securely attached
- No cold solder joints or lifted pads

### Power-Up Test

:prose-ol
1. Connect USB-C cable to computer
2. Measure voltages:
   - **3.3V rail**: Should be stable at 3.3V ±0.1V
   - **ESP32 power pins**: 3.3V present
3. Check for excessive heat on any components
4. LED indicators (if populated) should light up

### Programming Test

:prose-ol
1. Install ESP32 support in Arduino IDE (see [Firmware Guide](/firmware/getting-started))
2. Select **ESP32-S3 Dev Module** as board
3. Upload a simple "Blink" sketch
4. Verify code uploads successfully
5. Check serial output at 115200 baud

### Output Test

Test each MOSFET channel:

:prose-ol
1. Connect LEDs with resistors to each output
2. Upload test firmware (available in repository)
3. Verify each output can switch on/off
4. Check for proper logic levels (LOW = active)
5. Measure output current capability

::callout{icon="i-lucide-shield-alert" color="red"}
**Do NOT connect to motorcycle battery yet!** Complete all bench testing with USB power or a current-limited 12V supply first.
::

## Step 5: Motorcycle Installation

### Pre-Installation Planning

Before installing, plan your wiring:

:prose-ol
1. **Choose mounting location**
   - Under seat (most common)
   - Behind headlight nacelle
   - In side panel
   - Protected from water and vibration
2. **Measure wire lengths** needed
3. **Plan wire routing** to avoid moving parts
4. **Select connectors** for easy removal
5. **Document your wiring** for future reference

### Wiring Connections

**Power Input:**
```
12V+ (Battery) ────[Fuse 10A]────> Moto32 12V Input
Ground (Frame) ──────────────────> Moto32 GND
```

**Typical Output Assignments:**

| Output | Function | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| OUT1 | Headlight | High beam |
| OUT2 | Headlight | Low beam |
| OUT3 | Tail light | Running light |
| OUT4 | Brake light | Brake switch input |
| OUT5 | Turn signal | Left |
| OUT6 | Turn signal | Right |
| OUT7 | Horn | Momentary |
| OUT8 | Ignition coil | Kill switch input |

::callout{icon="i-lucide-info" color="blue"}
**Customizable**: These are suggestions only. Configure outputs to match your specific motorcycle requirements.
::

### Installation Steps

:prose-ol
1. **Disconnect battery** (negative terminal first)
2. **Mount Moto32 unit** with vibration-damping mounts
3. **Run power wires** with appropriate gauge (14-16 AWG)
4. **Install inline fuse** (10A recommended) near battery
5. **Connect ground** to clean frame ground point
6. **Route signal wires** for switches and sensors
7. **Connect output wires** to loads (lights, horn, etc.)
8. **Secure all connections** with heat shrink or connectors
9. **Double-check all wiring** against your diagram
10. **Reconnect battery** (positive first, then negative)

### First Power-Up on Motorcycle

:prose-ol
1. Turn ignition to ON position (don't start engine)
2. Check for smoke or unusual smells (if any, disconnect immediately)
3. Verify Moto32 powers up (LED indicators if present)
4. Test each function individually:
   - Lights (headlight, tail, brake)
   - Turn signals
   - Horn
5. Check for proper ground connections
6. Verify no voltage drop under load
7. Test with engine running for electrical noise immunity

### Final Testing

Before riding:

:prose-ul{icon="i-lucide-clipboard-check"}
- All lights function correctly
- Turn signals flash at proper rate
- Horn sounds clearly
- Kill switch cuts ignition
- No flickering or dimming under load
- All connections are secure
- No loose wires or sharp edges
- Emergency stop procedures tested

## Step 6: Configuration & Tuning

### Upload Production Firmware

Replace test firmware with your final configuration:

:prose-ol
1. Connect USB-C cable
2. Open Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
3. Configure pin mappings for your setup
4. Set input debounce times
5. Configure auto-cancel timers (if used)
6. Upload firmware

See [Firmware Configuration](/firmware/configuration) for detailed instructions.

### Fine-Tuning

Adjust settings based on real-world use:

- Turn signal flash rate
- Auto-cancel sensitivity
- Brake light delay
- Headlight modulation
- Custom sequences

## Troubleshooting

### Unit Won't Power Up

:prose-ul{icon="i-lucide-x-circle"}
- Check 12V input voltage at connector
- Verify ground connection
- Test buck converter output (should be 3.3V)
- Check for reverse polarity damage

### Outputs Don't Work

:prose-ul{icon="i-lucide-x-circle"}
- Verify MOSFET orientation during assembly
- Check gate drive signals with oscilloscope
- Test MOSFET with known good component
- Verify firmware output pin configuration

### USB Not Recognized

:prose-ul{icon="i-lucide-x-circle"}
- Install CH340 drivers for your OS
- Try different USB cable (must support data)
- Check USB-C connector solder joints
- Verify 3.3V present on CH340 chip

### ESP32 Won't Program

:prose-ul{icon="i-lucide-x-circle"}
- Hold BOOT button while connecting USB
- Select correct board in Arduino IDE
- Check serial port selection
- Verify ESP32 module is properly soldered
